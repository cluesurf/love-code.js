## TextSurf

This is being developed by the folks at [TextSurf](https://text.surf), a
California-based project for helping humanity master information and
computation. TextSurf started off in the winter of 2008 as a spark of an
idea, to forming a company 10 years later in the winter of 2018, to a
seed of a project just beginning its development phases. It is entirely
bootstrapped by working full time and running
[Etsy](https://etsy.com/shop/textsurf) and
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=p_27%3AMount+Build) shops. Also

other GitHub projects as well!
